# IPFIRE-Network-Security-Lab
The Network Security Lab explores IPFire's software firewall, focusing on traffic analysis, subnet masks, configurations, and caching features like the Update Accelerator. It evaluates the benefits and risks of web proxies, blacklisting, and open-source firewalls, comparing them with commercial options based on security, flexibility, and cost.
